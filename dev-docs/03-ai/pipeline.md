# AI Pipeline

> Last verified: 2026-05-27 (plan-030 stage-004 docs sync)

Every AI feature in Novellum follows the same pipeline. The runtime
agents (continuity / edit / rewrite / style) live in [src/lib/ai/](../../src/lib/ai/)
and the V1.1 staged-pipeline scaffolding lives in [src/lib/ai/pipeline/](../../src/lib/ai/pipeline/).
Both are consumed by feature modules through orchestrator factories.

## Prompt schema

All prompts conform to:

1. **ROLE.** Identity. ("You are the Novellum ContinuityAgent.")
2. **TASK.** Single-responsibility objective.
3. **CONTEXT.** Scoped, serialized JSON. Never the full manuscript.
4. **CONSTRAINTS.** Explicit negatives. ("Do not invent facts outside CONTEXT.")
5. **OUTPUT FORMAT.** Strict schema. The agent's parser will reject anything else.

The literal templates live in [src/lib/ai/constants.ts](../../src/lib/ai/constants.ts) and [src/lib/ai/prompt-builder.ts](../../src/lib/ai/prompt-builder.ts).

## Files in `src/lib/ai/pipeline/` (V1.1 staged pipeline)

Introduced in plan-027-v1.1-scoping. The staged pipeline runs alongside
the runtime agents — it does not replace them. It owns the multi-stage
`vibe-worldbuild` and `vibe-author` families gated by reviewer
checkpoints.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `contracts.ts` | `OUTLINE_HIERARCHY` 7-tuple, `PipelineTaskContract`, `PipelineArtifactEnvelope<T>`, `createPipelineArtifactEnvelope()`. |
| `task-catalog.ts` | `PIPELINE_TASK_KEYS`, `PIPELINE_TASK_CATALOG`, `PIPELINE_TASK_FAMILIES`, `resolvePipelineAction()`. |
| `prompt-library.ts` / `prompt-library-seeds.ts` | Per-stage prompt scaffolds (ROLE / TASK / CONSTRAINTS / OUTPUT). |
| `worldbuild-schemas.ts` | Zod schemas for the four `vibe-worldbuild.*` payloads (premise / worldspec / research / populated-bible). |
| `worldbuild-agent.ts` | `parseWorldbuildOutput()`, `createWorldbuildArtifactFromModelOutput()`, populated-bible normalizer. |
| `checkpoint-contract.ts` | `PIPELINE_CHECKPOINT_SCHEMA_VERSION='1.0.0'`, `WorldbuildCheckpointRecord`, lifecycle guards. |
| `checkpoint-service.ts` | `createWorldbuildCheckpointService(database)` — `upsert / review / accept / reject / list / get`. All mutations atomic. |

### vibe-worldbuild checkpoint flow

Four pipeline tasks ship today (`vibe-worldbuild.premise`,
`.worldspec`, `.research`, `.populated-world-bible`). Each artifact
envelope is stored in `project_metadata` under scope `'pipeline'` with
owner `'vibe-worldbuild'` and the artifact id as the key. The
lifecycle is `draft → review → accepted | rejected`.

Only `vibe-worldbuild.populated-world-bible` writes to canon. On
`accept`, `checkpoint-service.ts` opens a single SQLite transaction and
inserts into `factions`, `characters` (with `factionId` resolved by
name match), `locations`, `themes`, `glossary_terms`, `lore_entries`,
`plot_threads`, and `timeline_events`. A second `accept` on the same
checkpoint is idempotent. `reject` requires a non-empty `reason` and
preserves it on the record without touching canon.

The HTTP surface is
`/api/db/project-metadata/{projectId}/pipeline/{ownerId}/{key}` with a
discriminated `operation` payload (`upsert | review | accept | reject`).
The vibe-author family is scaffolded but not yet parser-wired; it ships
in stage-003.

### vibe-author review-gate flow

Stage-003 phase-003 ships the author drafting + revision surface:

- `src/lib/ai/pipeline/author-agent.ts` parses model output into
  `AuthorSceneDraftPayload` (prose + sidecar) and the revision pack
  schema.
- `src/lib/ai/pipeline/author-schemas.ts` exposes the Zod schemas and
  `AUTHOR_SEVERITY_ORDER` (`critical → high → medium → low`).
- `src/modules/nova/services/author-pipeline-runner.ts` —
  `runAuthorPipelineTask()` resolves the task, builds RAG context,
  streams via `OpenRouterClient.complete`, parses the result, and
  attaches a `NovaArtifact` to the Nova message via
  `novaSession.attachArtifact()`. Result variants surface
  `invalid_task | parse_failed | transport_failed | aborted` reasons.
- `src/modules/nova/components/NovaSceneDraftCard.svelte` renders the
  scene-draft envelope with explicit `Accept` / `Reject` / `Copy`
  controls (Copy goes through `navigator.clipboard`).
- `src/modules/nova/components/NovaRevisionPackCard.svelte` renders
  the revision-pack envelope as a severity-sorted issue list with a
  per-issue `Acknowledge` action.
- `src/modules/nova/components/NovaMessageLog.svelte` branches on
  `message.artifact?.kind` to pick the right card.

The review-gate guardrail is enforced at three layers:

1. **Component contract** — source-string tests
   (`tests/ai/pipeline/scene-draft-sidecar.test.ts`,
   `tests/ai/pipeline/revision-pack.test.ts`) forbid any
   manuscript-write import (`insertText`, `applyEdit`,
   `manuscriptStore`, `editorStore`).
2. **Runner contract** — Vitest coverage
   (`tests/nova/services/author-pipeline-runner.test.ts`) asserts the
   runner only attaches an artifact; it never reaches into the editor.
3. **HTTP contract** — Playwright spec
   (`tests/e2e/vibe-author-review-gates.spec.ts`) drives
   draft → review → accept for the scene-draft key and
   draft → reject for the revision-pack key, then verifies that
   `/api/db/scenes` and `/api/db/chapters` are still empty for the
   project. Manuscript content is never auto-mutated by the
   review-gate.

`Accept` emits the parsed envelope to an `onAccept` callback so a
later editor accept-pipeline can ledger the provenance (`taskKey`,
`family`, `stage`, `model`, `createdAt`). That integration is out of
scope for plan-027.

### Nova mode/workflow boundaries (plan-030)

Plan-030 tightens the Nova product contract without adding autonomous tool runtime:

- `chat` mode stays conversational and grounded to scoped project context.
- `scribe` mode only routes supported outline-generation requests to the author pipeline.
- Unsupported concrete Scribe requests render an explicit limitation state instead of fallback execution.
- Draft/revision artifacts remain proposal cards with explicit user review actions (no auto-apply).

Key enforcement tests:

- `tests/nova/nova-panel-chat.test.ts`
- `tests/nova/nova-artifact-cards.test.ts`
- `tests/nova/nova-surface-reconciliation.test.ts`

See [ADR-0027](../02-architecture/adr/adr-0027-pipeline-entity-scope.md)
for the V1.1 scope decision.

### Outline-first worldbuild UI (plan-028)

Plan-028 ships the hierarchical pipeline UI at `/projects/[id]/outline`.
The outline page renders a seven-layer hierarchy navigator
(Arc → Act → Milestone → Chapter → Scene → Beat → Stage) and a stage
detail panel that drives the worldbuild run/review/decision workflow.

**Run flow:** Stage selection + "Run Stage Pipeline" button →
`worldbuild-pipeline-runner.ts` validates the `PipelineHierarchyPath`,
sends task payload to `/api/ai`, parses via `createWorldbuildArtifactFromModelOutput`,
stages result as a `draft` checkpoint via project-metadata API. Runtime
states (`idle → ready → queued → running → completed_pending_checkpoint | failed`)
are managed in `outline-store.svelte.ts`.

**Review console:** The stage detail panel includes a checkpoint queue
with lifecycle filters (all / pending / accepted / rejected), an
artifact review detail panel (metadata grid, hierarchy references,
collapsible payload viewer), and explicit accept/reject decision
controls. Accept requires `review` lifecycle; reject requires a
non-empty reason.

**Canon safety:** No entity table writes occur during run or staging.
Canon projection happens only when `checkpoint-service.ts` processes an
`accept` operation on a `populated-world-bible` checkpoint. Source-contract
tests enforce this guarantee (89 tests across 6 test files). E2E specs
cover traversal, run/review/accept, reject/failure, and
invalid-transition handling.

**Deferred:** `vibe-author` UI parity is explicitly out of scope for
plan-028.

## Server boundary

The browser never holds the OpenRouter API key. All model calls go through `/api/ai` ([src/routes/api/ai/+server.ts](../../src/routes/api/ai/+server.ts)), which:

1. Reads the key from the OS keyring via [credential-service.ts](../../src/lib/ai/credential-service.ts).
2. Builds the OpenRouter request.
3. Streams the response back to the client.

## Constraints (always)

- **Author-in-the-loop.** Agents never auto-apply edits. They emit suggestions; the user accepts.
- **Scoped context.** No agent receives the full manuscript. The smallest viable context wins.
- **Schema-validated output.** Every agent has a parser; non-conforming output is rejected.
- **No silent retries with bigger context.** If an agent fails, surface the failure rather than escalate context size.
