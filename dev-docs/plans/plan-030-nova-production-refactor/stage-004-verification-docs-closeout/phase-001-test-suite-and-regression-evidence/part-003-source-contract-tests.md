# part-003 — Source Contract Tests

> Status: `complete`  
> Parent phase: `phase-001`  
> Parent stage: `stage-004`  
> Parent plan: `plan-030-nova-production-refactor`

## Objective

Verify generated artifacts remain proposal-only and do not import editor mutation paths.

## Problem

Nova currently needs this part because the sidepanel must be trustworthy before it can be treated as a production assistant. The work here should reduce ambiguity, remove misleading behavior, or strengthen regression coverage.

## Files

- `tests/ai/pipeline/*`
- `tests/nova/*`

## Required Changes

- No auto-apply imports.
- Author-in-loop preserved.

## UI / UX Requirements

- Preserve existing accessibility behavior unless explicitly replacing it with equivalent or better behavior.
- Make user-facing states honest.
- Do not expose controls that imply unsupported behavior.
- Keep copy short, concrete, and product-specific.

## Data / Context Requirements

- Project context must remain scoped and deterministic.
- Do not send the full manuscript by default.
- Treat generated content as proposal unless an explicit accept workflow exists.
- Missing context must be surfaced, not silently hidden.

## Error Handling Requirements

- Surface recoverable failures with actionable messages.
- Do not swallow context failures for project-dependent generation.
- Preserve existing retry/abort semantics unless the part explicitly changes them.

## Tests

- Add or update tests directly tied to this part.
- Prefer behavior-level assertions over brittle copy snapshots.
- Include source-contract tests where safety depends on absence of imports or mutations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No auto-apply imports.
- Author-in-loop preserved.
- Relevant tests are added or updated.
- No plan-030 non-negotiable constraints are violated.
- Evidence is recorded before moving to the next part.

## Out of Scope

- Full app redesign.
- Broad provider/model architecture changes.
- Autonomous tool-calling runtime.
- Direct manuscript mutation.
- Unrelated module cleanup.

## Evidence To Record

- Files changed.
- Commands run.
- Test results.
- Known limitations.
- Screenshot/visual note if this part affects UI.
