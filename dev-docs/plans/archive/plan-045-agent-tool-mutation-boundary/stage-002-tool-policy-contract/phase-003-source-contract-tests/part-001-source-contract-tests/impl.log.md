### [2026-06-09 00:00] Agent: Planner Agent

**Action:** Created part scaffold.

**Result:** Initialized `part.md`, `checklist.md`, `impl.log.md`, and `evidence/` for future full-plan expansion and execution.

**Notes:** No implementation work has started. Keep this log append-only when the part is executed.

### [2026-06-11 20:07 EDT] Agent: Codex

**Action:** Hardened the Nova Agent mutation boundary with source and runtime contract tests.

**Result:** Split accept/reject registrations into `agent-mutation-tools.ts`, kept `agent-tools.ts` free of author-draft accept/reject imports and IDs, and guarded `dispatchTool()` so mutation commands are rejected by default. Added `tests/nova/agent-tool-mutation-boundary.test.ts`, updated source-contract tests, and added router tests for the explicit mutation dispatch opt-in. Added `evidence/source-contract-tests-evidence-2026-06-11.md`.

**Validation:** `pnpm check` passed with 0 errors / 0 warnings. `pnpm lint` passed. `pnpm test tests/nova/agent-tool-mutation-boundary.test.ts tests/nova/agent-source-contracts.test.ts tests/nova/tool-registry.test.ts tests/nova/tool-router.test.ts tests/nova/agent-loop.test.ts tests/nova/chat-service.test.ts` passed (6 files / 60 tests).

**Notes:** Part and Stage 002 are ready for Reviewer Agent sign-off. Stage 003 can now formalize UI-issued mutation commands on top of the dispatcher opt-in.

### [2026-06-12 12:20] Agent: Reviewer Agent

**Action:** Reviewed the Plan-045 implementation against the mutation-boundary objective, source contracts, tracker state, and current quality gates.

**Result:** Approved. Model-callable Agent tools are limited to read-only and review-artifact generation capabilities; mutation commands are isolated in `agent-mutation-tools.ts`, excluded from model advertisement, and blocked by default dispatch. Explicit UI review actions remain available for author accept/reject flows.

**Validation:** `pnpm test tests/nova/tool-registry.test.ts tests/nova/tool-router.test.ts tests/nova/agent-loop.test.ts tests/nova/chat-service.test.ts tests/nova/agent-tool-mutation-boundary.test.ts tests/nova/agent-source-contracts.test.ts` passed (6 files / 63 tests). `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:css`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm check:tokens`, and `pnpm test:e2e --grep "vibe-author review-gate flow|outline generation review gate|vibe-worldbuild checkpoint flow" --project=chromium` all passed.

**Notes:** Reviewer sign-off granted; status may roll up to `complete`.
